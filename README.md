# Optimizing-Snake-Game-with-Genetic-Algorithm

This project leverages genetic algorithms to optimize AI performance in the classic Snake game using Python. By employing evolutionary strategies, the AI continuously refines its gameplay tactics, enhancing its ability to navigate the game environment and achieve higher scores. This implementation demonstrates how advanced algorithms can improve decision-making and adaptability in game environments.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Utilizes evolutionary strategies to evolve the AI's performance over time.
- **AI Optimization**: Continuously refines gameplay tactics for better navigation and higher scores.
- **Pygame Integration**: Implements the Snake game using the Pygame library.
- **Game Development**: Showcases how AI can be applied in game development for smarter, more adaptive gameplay.

## How It Works

### Genetic Algorithm Overview

The AI uses a genetic algorithm to evolve its gameplay strategy. Key components include:

- **Population**: A set of AI agents (snakes) with different strategies.
- **Fitness Function**: Measures how well each agent performs, based on the score achieved.
- **Selection**: Chooses the best-performing agents for reproduction.
- **Crossover**: Combines strategies from selected agents to create a new generation.
- **Mutation**: Introduces random changes to new agents to maintain diversity.
